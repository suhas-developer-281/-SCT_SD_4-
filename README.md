# Task 4 – Product Info Scraper (GUI-Based 🛍️)

## 📌 Description
This is my fourth and final task as a Software Development Intern at **SkillCraft Technology**.

The goal of this task is to create a **user-driven GUI application** that:
- Takes **user input** (product keyword like "men", "electronics")
- Extracts **product name**, **price**, and **rating**
- Saves the results into a structured **CSV file**

The program uses the [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com), a publicly available RESTful API for e-commerce-like product data.
